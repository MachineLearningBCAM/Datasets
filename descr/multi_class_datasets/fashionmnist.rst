Title: Fashion Mnist Dataset

Sources: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist?hl=es-419


Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60000 examples and a test set of 10000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
